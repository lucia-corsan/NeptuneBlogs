## [Strategies For Effective Prompt Engineering](https://neptune.ai/blog/prompt-engineering-strategies)
The article dives deep into prompt engineering strategies, focusing on:
- **Instruction-based**, **context-based**, and **example-based approaches to optimize large language models (LLMs)**
- Assesing the effectiveness of prompts through metrics like accuracy, fluency, and creativity.
- **Chain-of-Thought**, **Prompt Templates** and **Dynamic Prompts** (and when to apply or avoid them).
- **A/B testing** to refine prompts for complex tasks.

> The snippets of code corresponding to this article are:
>  - `Evaluating Prompts Notebook.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook with the examples to assess prompts' quality according to diversity, fluency and perplexity.
>  - `A_B Testing Notebook.ipynb`: Tutorial to perform basic A/B testing to evaluate prompts.
